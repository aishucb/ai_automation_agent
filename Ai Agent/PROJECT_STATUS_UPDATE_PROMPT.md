‚úÖ **Generates and refines email content using Gemini LLM**
- Focus on primary campaigns (e.g., SustainSpark8 event)
- Use structured campaign folders with context.json
- Automatically refine email content based on performance metrics
- Multiple email types: invite, reminder, thank_you, follow_up

‚úÖ **Automates workflows for sending emails**
- Schedule invites, reminders, thank-you notes, and follow-ups
- APScheduler with MongoDB job store
- Each step runs without manual intervention
- Campaign pause/resume functionality
